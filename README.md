**Sustainability Tracker: Create a carbon footprint tracker with recommendations for greener operations.**

A cutting-edge, AI-powered dashboard for real-time logistics emissions tracking and sustainability optimization. Built with Streamlit, this tool empowers organizations to reduce carbon footprints, achieve SDG 13 compliance, and drive data-driven decisions for greener operations.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Transport contributes ~24% of direct CO‚ÇÇ emissions globally (IPCC 2022). Logistics inefficiencies exacerbate Scope 1 emissions, costing firms millions in fuel and compliance. This tool enables proactive emission reductions, with potential savings of ‚Çπ50 lakhs annually through 20% efficiency gains (McKinsey, 2023).

**Key Citations:**
- IPCC (2022): Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report.
- McKinsey (2023): Sustainability in Logistics.
- India's NDC: 33-35% emission reduction by 2030.

## ‚ú® What This Project Does

The NexGen Sustainability Tracker is a comprehensive, AI-enhanced platform designed to transform logistics operations into sustainable, data-driven practices. It provides organizations with actionable insights to monitor, analyze, and reduce carbon emissions from transportation activities, directly addressing Scope 1 emissions in supply chains.

### Key Capabilities
- **Emission Quantification**: Accurately calculates CO‚ÇÇ emissions per order using fuel data or distance-based models, ensuring precise tracking.
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Suggests greener vehicle assignments, route adjustments, and operational changes to minimize environmental impact.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts future emissions and simulates "what-if" scenarios (e.g., EV transitions) to guide strategic decisions.
- **Business ROI**: Quantifies savings from efficiency gains, including fuel costs, maintenance, and carbon offsets, with ROI calculators.
- **Gamified Engagement**: Encourages user participation through leaderboards, challenges, and AI-driven tips for long-term sustainability.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates downloadable reports and visualizations for compliance, audits, and stakeholder communication.

By integrating real-time data from orders, routes, vehicles, and costs, the tool empowers users to achieve measurable reductions in emissions, align with global standards like SDG 13, and unlock financial benefits.
